# DuetWifi Cartesian 3D Printer

Creating a new Cartessian 3D printer using the AM8 build on Thingieverse (https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2263216 and https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2394506) to create a custom built cartesian 3D printer

# What do you need?

*1 x DuetWiFi
*4 x 0.9 degree stepper motors
*1 x E3D Titan Aero with pancake motor
*1 x 220 x 220 heated bed (I use the Anycubic ultrabase but completely up to you)

I would also advise plenty of time for the build and commissioning of the printer! (At least 6-8 hours of work in this maybe more!)

Also check the BOM in the AM8 build on thingieverse for your hardware needs for the frame, no point writing them all out here!

# Things to think about

My build uses NO Microswitches, the basic 3 prong microswitches without the LED lights, so make sure if you are using my code that you check which you are using and adapt the code to suit.
